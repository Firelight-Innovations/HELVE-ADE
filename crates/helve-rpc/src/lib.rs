//! JSON-RPC over newline-delimited JSON on the standard streams -- transport
//! A of `docs/tool-protocol.md`. This crate is both halves of that pipe:
//! the host side that spawns a tool process and calls into it
//! ([`ToolProcess`]), and the tool side that answers on stdin/stdout
//! ([`serve`]). A tool binary and the orchestrator that spawns it both
//! depend on this crate, so the wire format only has one implementation to
//! drift out of sync with the spec.

// This crate is a published contract: tool repositories depend on it, and its
// public surface is the part they read. STANDARDS.md §4.1 asks every module to
// document what it is for, and §5 asks for private modules with flat public
// re-exports — the shape declared just below. Both are enforced here rather
// than in [workspace.lints] because neither is true of `src-tauri`, which is an
// application, not a library. See the root Cargo.toml for the full reasoning.

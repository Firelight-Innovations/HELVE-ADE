//! Wave 9: "Declare the 6 budgets in section 14.7 inside Schematify's own
//! `.kaava/` project, each with its probe command" (PRD §17, Wave 9).
//!
//! `self/.kaava/` is that project — Schematify describing itself, as distinct
//! from the reference fixtures under `fixtures/`, which PRD §14.7's last
//! paragraph calls out as project data that sits outside this rule.
//!
//! This test is the authority §14.6 asks every wave to use: rather than eyeball
//! six hand-written JSON files against the schema in section 5.10, load them
//! through this crate's own `load_project` and `Node::budget`, then pin every
//! field against the section 14.7 table by value. A field that drifts from the
//! table, a probe command that stops matching a real `pnpm bench:*` script, or
//! a tier that quietly changed from `hard` to `soft` all fail here first.

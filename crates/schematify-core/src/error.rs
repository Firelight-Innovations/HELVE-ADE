//! The one error type this crate returns across its public surface.
//!
//! STANDARDS.md section 5 asks for one enum per bounded domain rather than one
//! per module, and for a message that names the value that failed. The
//! narrower errors below - a bad slug, a bad URI, an illegal transition - keep
//! their own types because a caller acts on them differently, and each of them
//! converts into this one so a command handler in wave 2 has a single
//! `Result` to return.

//! The rule registry and the library registry of PRD sections 5.10 and 10.
//!
//! These two are registries rather than nodes, and they behave differently
//! from each other on disk. A rule is one file per entry like everything else.
//! The library registry is one file holding an array, and it is the stated
//! exception to the one-node-per-file rule: PRD section 10.3 derives the whole
//! tech-stack view from it, and a derivation that has to open two hundred
//! files to answer "which modules use jose" is a derivation nobody runs.
//!
//! License enforcement runs at design time, which is what makes the registry
//! worth a file of its own. A GPL dependency is a blocked add while somebody
//! is drawing, rather than a legal finding after a release.

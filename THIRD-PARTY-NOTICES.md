# Third-party notices

Code from other projects that this repository incorporates **in source form**,
and the licenses it arrives under.

This file is not a dependency list. Crates and npm packages are declared in
`Cargo.toml` and `package.json`, their licenses are checked by
`cargo deny check` (`deny.toml`), and none of them is copied into this tree.
What is listed here is the narrower and rarer case: source that was read,
adapted and committed here, where the obligation travels with the file rather
than with a lockfile entry.

`NOTICE` covers this repository's own license and the trademarks that license
does not grant. This one covers everyone else's.

## stablyai/orca — MIT

- **Upstream:** <https://github.com/stablyai/orca>
- **License:** MIT
- **Copyright:** © Stably AI
- **Used in:** HELVE's Design Mode

Orca is an open-source Electron application that runs coding agents in git
worktrees. Its "Design Mode" — click an element in an embedded browser, send
its markup, styles and a cropped screenshot to an agent — is the feature
HELVE's Design Mode is adapted from.

What was carried across is the **approach and the data model**, and in places
the shape of the code: a full-viewport click catcher in a closed shadow root,
`document.elementFromPoint` with the catcher briefly disabled, hashed-class
filtering when building a selector, and a payload with per-field budgets rather
than a whole document. The files that carry adapted code name their source in
their own headers:

| File here | Adapted from |
|---|---|
| `src-tauri/src/apps/design_probe.js` | `src/main/browser/grab-guest-script.ts` |

What was **not** carried across is everything about how Orca embeds and drives
the page. That is Electron's `BrowserView`, `webContents.executeJavaScript` and
`capturePage`, none of which has an equivalent in Tauri; the embedding,
injection and capture here are a Rust rewrite against WebView2 and are original
to this repository. `docs/design-notes/design-mode.md` records why each of those
had to be rebuilt rather than ported.

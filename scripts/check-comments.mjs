/**
 * Comment-density checks for Rust and TypeScript, with a ratchet.
 *
 * STANDARDS.md §4 asks this codebase to explain itself in prose, and it does —
 * but prose has a runaway mode, and two shapes of it are worth catching:
 *
 *   RATIO  a file that is more than half comment. At that point the code is
 *          an illustration inside an essay rather than the other way round.
 *
 *   RUN    an unbroken wall of more than 15 comment lines. This is the one
 *          that actually prompted the check. `src-tauri/src/apps/files.rs` is
 *          only 32% comment overall and still reads as overwhelming, because
 *          its 610 comment lines arrive in long uninterrupted blocks. Ratio
 *          alone does not see that; run length does.
 *
 * The two catch genuinely different files, which is why both are on. Neither
 * is a statement that the prose is wrong — §4 is still the standard, and a
 * long comment that records a rejected alternative is the most valuable thing
 * in the repo. These are limits on *concentration*, not on total.
 *
 * Grandfathering works like scripts/clippy-baseline.mjs: `comment-baseline.json`
 * records what each offending file looks like today, and a file may not get
 * worse than the larger of its baseline and the cap. New files must meet the
 * cap outright.
 *
 * Known limitation: this is line-based, not a parser. A line inside a template
 * literal that begins with `//` counts as a comment. In practice that is rare
 * enough not to justify pulling in two real parsers, but it is why the caps are
 * generous rather than tight.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs            check against the baseline
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs --update    rewrite the baseline
 *   node scripts/check-comments.mjs --report    print every file, worst first

 * 15 would have flagged 116 of 168 files — a number that describes an ambition
 * rather than this codebase. 20 still catches every wall worth calling a wall,
 * including the one that prompted the rule: `src-tauri/src/apps/files.rs` is
 * only 32% comment overall but has a 35-line unbroken block.

 * those installers live — that is this file's job, because only the release
 * workflow knows the tag the assets are about to hang off.
 *
 * The shaping is exported and unit-tested rather than done inline in YAML. A
 * manifest is read by every installed copy of HELVE and is the one artifact in
 * the release nobody looks at: a wrong `url` is a silent no-op on every machine
 * at once, and there is no failing build to notice it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/update-manifest.mjs --dir artifacts --tag v0.2.0 > latest.json
 *   node scripts/update-manifest.mjs --dir artifacts --tag v0.2.0 --notes "..."

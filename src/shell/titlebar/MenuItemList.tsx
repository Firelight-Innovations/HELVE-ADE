/**
 * The item tree shared by both menu surfaces.
 *
 * The inline menu bar's dropdown and the hamburger's accordion render the same
 * `MenuItem[]` the same way — one list component rather than two, so the two
 * responsive states can never drift into showing different trees for the same
 * menu.
 *
 * An item that cannot act is `disabled: true` — a real native `disabled`
 * button, which neither fires `onSelect` nor closes the menu, because a click
 * that lands on a control with nothing to do should not read as having done
 * something. That is the only inert state left worth having: an item with no
 * `onSelect` at all now means the Run and Help menus, which are the two this
 * work deliberately did not touch.
 *
 * `hint` rides on the `<li>` rather than the button for the reason the contract
 * gives: a `disabled` button takes no pointer events, so a `title` on it would
 * be readable on precisely the items that never need explaining.
 *
 * ## It has state now, and it did not before
 *
 * Two rows are no longer plain buttons — one opens a submenu, one opens a text
 * field — and both of those are *open or closed*, which is state. It lives here
 * rather than in each of the three surfaces that render this list, because all
 * three would otherwise need identical copies of it and the whole point of one
 * list component is that they do not have to agree about anything.
 *
 * At most one of either is open at a time, so the two share one `openLabel`:
 * opening the second closes the first, which is what a menu does.
 *
 * ## Why the extra surfaces are portalled
 *
 * All three hosts clip. `.menubar__dropdown` and `.addapp__menu` are both
 * `overflow: hidden`, and `.addapp__menu` additionally lives under a bar whose
 * `.switcher__tabs` is a horizontal scroll container — the problem that file's
 * header describes at length. A submenu drawn inside any of them would be cut
 * off at the parent's edge. So it is a portal into `document.body`, positioned
 * from the row's measured rectangle, and flipped to the row's left when there is
 * no room on its right.
 *
 * The container is `document.body` always, never a moving element, so the
 * remount-on-container-change hazard `ToolWindow` and `PaneTree` document does
 * not arise — and there is no iframe in a menu to reload if it did.

 * A hover-revealed scrollbar that floats over a horizontally-scrolling strip
 * instead of reserving track space at its edge. The two strips it draws for —
 * `.panel__tabs-strip` and `.switcher__tabs` — hide their native scrollbar
 * outright (see the comments beside `scrollbar-width: none` in panel.css and
 * switcher.css for why that property specifically); what replaces it is a
 * `motion.div` thumb, sized and positioned by hand from the container's own
 * `scrollLeft`/`scrollWidth`/`clientWidth`, which framer-motion can fade.
 *
 * This component draws only the thumb, never the scroll container: the element
 * with `overflow-x: auto` stays the caller's, reached only through `targetRef`,
 * because a thumb that *was* its child would scroll away with the content. The
 * caller owns *where* this JSX mounts — an ancestor box sized to exactly the
 * strip it tracks, that is not itself the thing that scrolls.
 *
 * The thumb is draggable, redirects a plain wheel's `deltaY` into `scrollLeft`,
 * and tracks hover by rect rather than `pointerenter`. Reasons for all three,
 * and why it needs no `useDrag.tsx` coordination: `docs/design-notes/shell-core.md`.

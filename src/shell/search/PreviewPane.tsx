/**
 * The lower-right region of the search overlay: a read-only look at whichever
 * file the results list or the locator tree currently has focused.
 *
 * The user can never edit, save, or type into this pane — `readOnly` and
 * `domReadOnly` are hard-coded `true` in `./previewMonaco.ts` and nothing here
 * flips either. That is why this component owns no dirty state, no save handler
 * and no conflict banner; `apps/files/ui/src/viewer/TextViewer.tsx` has those
 * because that pane is written to. This one only ever reads.
 *
 * Everything Monaco-shaped is in `./previewMonaco.ts`, mirroring the split
 * `TextViewer.tsx`/`monaco.ts` draw in `apps/files/`: this file is a React
 * component and a state machine, holding only that module's opaque types.
 *
 * Meant to be reached the way `DiffView` is — a `lazy(() => import(…))` one
 * level up — so Monaco and its worker chunk are not paid for until the search
 * overlay actually mounts a preview. This module pulls Monaco in on evaluation
 * (via `./previewMonaco`), so the `lazy` boundary belongs at this file, not
 * inside it.

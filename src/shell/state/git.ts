/**
 * The frontend half of source control.
 *
 * Mirrors `src-tauri/src/git.rs`. One-shot calls and no subscription: there is
 * no filesystem watcher behind this, so nothing here can push. The panel re-asks
 * after every mutation, and that is the entire update model — deliberately
 * unlike `shellState.ts`, where several windows must agree so Rust broadcasts.
 *
 * Two interfaces, split by *subject* rather than by scope — both take a cluster
 * id. `gitControl` is the index: what has changed, what is staged, commit it.
 * `worktreeControl` is the checkout a cluster has been given of its own: which
 * worktrees exist, the repository's history, how far this one has diverged.
 * Ids rather than paths in both, and for the same reason: resolving one to a
 * directory is Rust's job, which keeps checkout paths out of the interface
 * entirely — `contract.ts` says the shell never learns one, and this is where
 * that would otherwise leak.
 *
 * `gitControl` took a *tool* id until that was found to fail for every project,
 * for reasons the note on `git_cluster_status` in `git.rs` tells in full.

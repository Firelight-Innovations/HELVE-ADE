/**
 * Where a tool's iframe points.

 * Mirrors `src-tauri/src/tool_frontend.rs`. In development this resolves to the
 * tool's own Vite server, so its hot reload works inside the real shell; in a
 * release build it resolves to the tool's built bundle on the `kaava-tool://`
 * scheme. The frontend never constructs either URL — it asks and mounts what it
 * is given.
 *
 * Resolution is per-tool and on demand rather than part of the stack snapshot,
 * because both answers can change while the shell is running: a dev server can
 * be started or stopped, and a checkout can be built.

 * them over their panes, so this never unmounts on a tab switch, a split, a
 * divider drag, or a tab being dragged into another pane. That is the property
 * the whole arrangement exists to protect: an iframe that remounts reloads the
 * app inside it, and a Files that forgot its open file every time you
 * rearranged the layout would make the layout not worth rearranging.

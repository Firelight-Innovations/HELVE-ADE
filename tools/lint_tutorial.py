"""Lint the prose inside a tutorial content file.

The tutorials' words live as string literals in `apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/`,
and `ste_lint.py` reads Markdown. This pulls the prose-bearing block bodies out
into a scratch `.md` and lints that, so line numbers in the report point at the
extracted prose rather than at the TypeScript.

`code` and `keys` blocks are skipped: a command is not prose, and linting one
flags every flag as a spelling error.

Usage: python -X utf8 tools/lint_tutorial.py apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/search.ts

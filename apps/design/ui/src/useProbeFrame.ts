 * picking, take the overlay off screen and wait for it to have been *painted*
 * off before photographing, put it back afterwards. Each of those has a wrong
 * order that still appears to work — a screenshot with the highlight box in it,
 * a probe that never arrives because the document was created before the script
 * existed — and keeping them in one file is what makes the order reviewable.
 *
 * The identity rule is the same one `ToolWindow.tsx` uses for the shell's own
 * frames: a message is this frame's only if `event.source` is the frame's own
 * `contentWindow`, compared against the reference React gave us. Nothing in a
 * message body is ever consulted to decide who sent it.

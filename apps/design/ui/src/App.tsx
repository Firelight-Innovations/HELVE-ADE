/**
 * Design Mode: a page you are building, beside what a click on it produced.
 *
 * The layout is two columns and stays two columns, because the pair is the
 * point. Clicking an element and then losing sight of the page in order to read
 * what was captured is how somebody ends up unsure which element they picked.
 *
 * This component owns no sequencing — `useProbeFrame` does, and its header says
 * why the order matters. What is here is the address bar, the pick toggle, the
 * panel that reads out a capture, and the box that turns one into a comment.
 *
 * **Leaving a comment is the primary action; copying is the fallback.** The
 * clipboard is kept because it still works and costs one button, and it is what
 * a chat client wants. What it cannot do is reach an agent in a terminal, which
 * is the whole reason `design_comments` and `mcp::servers::design` exist.

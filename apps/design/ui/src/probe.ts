/**
 * The conversation between this app and the probe inside the page it is showing.
 *
 * The two halves cannot import each other. The probe is
 * `src-tauri/src/apps/design_probe.js`, compiled into the binary and injected
 * by WebView2 into a document on somebody else's origin; this is TypeScript in
 * the shell's own build. Nothing links them but `window.postMessage` and the
 * shapes below, so the shapes are restated here for the same reason
 * `apps/files/ui/src/rpc.ts` restates its backend's — a drift is caught by
 * reading two files, and there is no third place claiming to be authoritative.
 *
 * Everything arriving here is **untrusted**. It comes from a frame this shell
 * did not write, running a page it did not choose, and a page can post whatever
 * it likes to its parent. So this module's real job is not decoding, it is
 * refusing: {@link readProbeMessage} returns `null` for anything it cannot
 * fully account for, and the app treats `null` as silence.
 *
 * What it deliberately does **not** do is decide whether the sender is allowed
 * to be heard. That is `event.source === iframe.contentWindow`, checked at the
 * listener against the shell's own reference to the frame it mounted — the same
 * rule `ToolWindow.tsx` uses, and the only one a message body cannot forge.

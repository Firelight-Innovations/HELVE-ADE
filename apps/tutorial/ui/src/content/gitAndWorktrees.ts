 * Source control, and the worktree offer.
 *
 * The worktree half is the one worth the tutorial. OpenKaava offers a worktree on
 * the first open of a repository, which is a prompt most people have never seen
 * from an editor — and declining it is the right answer often enough that the
 * dialog needs explaining rather than just answering.

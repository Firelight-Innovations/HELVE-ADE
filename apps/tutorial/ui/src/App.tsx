/**
 * Tutorials — the app that explains the rest of them.
 *
 * Two halves that never talk to the machine. The **catalog** comes from
 * `src-tauri/src/apps/tutorial.rs`, because Home draws the same list and a
 * second copy of it there would be a second place to add a tutorial. The
 * **prose** is `content/`, in this repo's own frontend, because it is a view —
 * `docs/tutorials.md` §2 has the whole of that argument.
 *
 * The seam between them is an id. A catalog entry with no body in `content/`
 * renders an honest "not written yet" panel rather than an error, which is the
 * same thing a genuinely unwritten tutorial should show — so the two halves can
 * be edited in either order, and the failure mode of getting it wrong is a
 * missing page rather than a broken app.
 *
 * Nothing here is cluster-scoped. `tutorial::call` ignores its `CallContext`,
 * so a Tutorials tab reads the same in a window with no project open as in one
 * with a checkout — which is the state a person reading "your first project" is
 * most likely to be in.

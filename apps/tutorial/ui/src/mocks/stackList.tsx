/** The switcher bar's health popover, mid-setup — see `HealthPopover.tsx`.
 *
 *  Three things here are the real component's rules rather than a choice.
 *  Only unwell tools have rows, so a healthy one is absent instead of green;
 *  only authoring tools can appear, because `WindowRoot` filters the list to
 *  `kind === "dev-tool"`; and the words are `HEALTH_LABEL`'s, never the
 *  backend's `mismatch` / `unversioned` / `missing`, which `contract.ts` keeps
 *  off the screen on purpose.
 *
 *  Tones follow `HEALTH_TOKEN`: both "needs update" and "not tracked" warn,
 *  "not installed" errs, which is the point `theStack.ts` spends its middle
 *  section on. Nothing is actually pinned in `kaava.toml` today, so an empty
 *  popover — not this one — is what a fresh machine shows; see the note below. */

/** One row per unwell tool, in the order `kaava.toml` pins them.
 *
 *  Illustrative names, not real ones. Two real entries used to make this
 *  screen real; both are now the single Schematify app (see
 *  `apps/README.md`), and `kaava.toml`'s `[[tool]]` array is empty, so this
 *  mocks a hypothetical third-party tool pair rather than a live state. */

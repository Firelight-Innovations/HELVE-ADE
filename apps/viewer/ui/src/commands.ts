/**
 * The title bar's File and Edit menus, from this side.
 *
 * The shell's menu bar cannot reach into this app — File Viewer runs in an
 * iframe and the shell must not import its hooks or poke its DOM. So a menu
 * item is a *message*: the shell posts a transport-B `command` to the active
 * frame and this module answers it. `docs/tool-protocol.md` §3 has the wire
 * shape; `@helve/bridge`'s `onCommand` is the receiving end.
 *
 * There is a second copy of this file in `apps/files/ui/src/`, answering the
 * commands that act on the tree. Neither knows about the other: each declares
 * what it can do, the shell aims a command at whichever surface is active, and
 * the menu is the union of what the active frame offered — which is why the
 * split needed no change in the title bar at all.
 *
 * Two arguments live in `docs/design-notes/viewer-app.md`: why declaring is the
 * more important half of the feature, and why the ids below are spelled out
 * rather than imported from the shell.

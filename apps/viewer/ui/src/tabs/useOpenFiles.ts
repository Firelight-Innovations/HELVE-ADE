/**
 * The open-file model: which tabs exist, which is showing, which are dirty, and
 * the buffers behind them.
 *
 * Two things live here that look like they belong elsewhere, and both are here
 * for the same reason — `ViewerProps` in `../viewer/registry.ts` is a fixed
 * four-prop contract and a viewer cannot be handed anything else.
 *
 * 1. `documents`, a module-scope store of one Monaco model per open path. It is
 *    *not* hook state: `TextViewer` has no route to a hook's closure, and the
 *    whole point of the store is that a model outlives the viewer that mounted
 *    it — which is what makes undo history, cursor and scroll survive a tab
 *    switch. One Files frame per window, so one store.
 *
 * 2. `saveDocument`, the single implementation of "write this buffer to disk".
 *    Both the viewer's registered save and the close-a-dirty-tab prompt go
 *    through it, so there is one place that knows about `baseMtime` and one
 *    place that can be wrong.
 *
 * **The Monaco import below is `import type` and must stay that way.** It is
 * erased before Rollup builds the graph, so this module — which `App.tsx`
 * imports at load — never pulls Monaco into the Files entry chunk. A plain
 * `import` here would undo the dynamic-`import()` discipline that
 * `../viewer/registry.ts` exists to protect. Nothing in this file *creates* a
 * model; it only holds and disposes ones `TextViewer` made.
 *
 * The numbers, so the warning is not just a warning: the Files entry chunk is
 * 175 kB and contains no Monaco at all (`grep -c monaco dist/assets/files-*.js`
 * returns 0). Monaco is 3.86 MB, in a chunk fetched only when a text file is
 * first opened. Dropping the word `type` from line 35 moves that 3.86 MB into
 * the 175 kB — a twenty-fold entry chunk, paid on every Files launch including
 * the ones that only ever look at a PNG. Nothing would fail; `tsc` and the
 * build would both stay green. That is exactly why it is written down here.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do: watch the filesystem. There is no
 * watcher, so external changes are noticed by `stat`-ing the open files on tab
 * activate and on the window regaining focus. That is a poll and it has a
 * window — the `baseMtime` guard on `files/write` is the backstop that catches
 * what the poll misses, and it catches it at the only moment that matters.

   * special-cased. The DOM fires `click` before `dblclick`, so double-clicking
   * a file in the tree arrives as a preview open followed by this same function
   * with `preview: false` — which promotes the tab the first click just made.
   * That is exactly VS Code's sequence, and it falls out rather than being
   * arranged.

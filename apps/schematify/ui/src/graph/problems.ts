 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, the same convention `./navigation.ts` and this

 * panel which invents a cell becomes a 2nd, drifting definition of what a
 * rule found. `locationCell` below restates `Location::cell()`'s *format*
 * against data the wire already carries (`id`/`title`/`slug`) — not a 2nd
 * *answer* to what the rule found, which is the thing that rule forbids.

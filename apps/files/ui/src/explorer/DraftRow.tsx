/**
 * The row you type a new file's name into — or an existing one's new name.
 *
 * It sits in the tree where the entry is going to sit, wearing the same indent,
 * the same icon column and the same height as every other row — because the
 * question it is asking is "what is this called", and asking it in a dialog
 * would take the answer out of the place the answer belongs. VS Code's model,
 * and the reason it feels like naming a thing rather than filling in a form.
 *
 * A rename is the same row with the name already in it, which is why there is
 * one component and not two: renaming is not a different gesture from naming,
 * it is naming something that already had one. The row *replaces* the entry's
 * own row for the duration rather than joining the list beside it — the entry
 * is not gaining a sibling, it is being re-labelled where it stands.
 *
 * How the question behaves — Enter, Escape, click-away, the empty answer, the
 * unchanged answer, what happens after a failure — is `../useInlineName`, which
 * the tab strip's rename shares. This file owns only what the question *looks*
 * like inside a tree.
 *
 * The icon updates as you type, from the same resolver the real rows use. It is
 * free, and it is the earliest possible confirmation that `.ts` was understood
 * as TypeScript rather than as part of the name.

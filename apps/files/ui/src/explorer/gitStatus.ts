/**
 * The tree's git decoration: what changed, reshaped for `TreeRow` and for the
 * directories that hold a change without showing it.
 *
 * `GitChangeKind`, `GIT_KIND_TOKEN` and `GIT_KIND_LETTER` restate
 * `src/shell/contract.ts`'s source-control panel exactly rather than
 * importing it — see `rpc.ts`'s header for why an app under `apps/` never
 * reaches into `src/`. If the values below drift from that file, that file is
 * the one to trust; this is a copy, not a second decision.
 *
 * ## What "like VS Code" turned out to mean
 *
 * Four rules, and `decorate` below is all four in one place:
 *
 * 1. A file git named gets its name tinted and a letter at the row's end.
 * 2. A directory with a change *below* it gets the tint and no letter. The
 *    letter is a statement about the row it sits on, and a folder has not
 *    itself been modified because something inside it was.
 * 3. Everything inside an untracked directory is untracked too — git collapses
 *    such a directory into one entry, but VS Code marks every file you find
 *    when you open it, so the collapsed entry is expanded here by prefix.
 * 4. An ignored path is greyed and says nothing else. It has no status to
 *    report: git is not tracking it.
 *
 * One rule that reads as missing and is not: a deleted file is not struck
 * through, because it has no row. This tree is listed from disk, and a file
 * git reports as deleted is gone from disk — staged or not. Its parent folders
 * still tint through rule 2, which is the only place a deletion can show here.
 * The source control panel is where the file itself appears.

   * to find out.
   *

   * switched in a terminal, an edit from another editor. Both events, for the
   * reason `useOpenFiles.ts` gives where it watches the same pair: this app is
   * an iframe, `focus` misses an alt-tab away and back when focus was
   * elsewhere in the shell, and `visibilitychange` misses a move between two
   * visible windows.
   *
   * This is not a file watcher, and the difference is visible: a change made
   * outside shows when you come back to the tree, not the instant it lands.
   * The refetch is cheap — around 50ms, and the ignore list is not part of it

 * item is a *message*: the shell posts a transport-B `command` to the active
 * frame, and this module is what this frame does about it.
 * `docs/tool-protocol.md` §3 has the wire shape; `@helve/bridge`'s `onCommand`
 * is the receiving end.
 *
 * `docs/design-notes/files-app.md` holds two notes this header used to carry:
 * the second copy of this module in the Viewer, answering the commands that act
 * on an open buffer with no coordination between the two; and why `file/delete`
 * is declared there rather than here, a real narrowing taken deliberately.

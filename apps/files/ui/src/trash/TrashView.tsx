/**
 * What this project has deleted, and the way back.
 *
 * Sits in the explorer pane in place of the tree. Same pane, same visual
 * language — rows, the same icons, the same hover — because it is the same kind
 * of thing: a list of files you can act on. What it is not is a second file
 * browser, so there is no expanding, no filter and no keyboard tree: every item
 * here is flat by nature, since a deleted folder is one item and not a subtree
 * you can walk.
 *
 * ## It only ever shows this project
 *
 * `trash/list` is scoped in the backend to items whose original location was
 * inside the project root, and restore and purge look their id up in that same
 * scoped set. That matters more than it sounds: the system Recycle Bin holds
 * everything the user has ever deleted anywhere, and showing it raw would put
 * their personal files inside a game editor. Nothing in this file widens that —
 * it renders what it is given. See `src-tauri/src/apps/trash.rs`.
 *
 * ## Freshness
 *
 * The Recycle Bin changes outside this app — the user can empty it from
 * Explorer, restore something from there, or delete a file with any other
 * program. So this list is a *snapshot*, and it says when it was taken rather
 * than pretending to be live. It re-reads whenever the view is opened, whenever
 * the refresh button is pressed, and after any action taken here. There is no
 * watcher and no poll, for the same reason `useOpenFiles` has neither.
 *
 * The honest consequence: an item can disappear between the list and the click.
 * The backend answers that with "not in this project's Recycle Bin — it may have
 * been restored, purged, or emptied since the list was read", which is shown as
 * it arrives.

/**
 * A raster image, and the two numbers people actually opened it for.
 *
 * Fit-to-pane by default, click for 1:1 with scrollbars when the natural size
 * overflows. Below it, a strip carrying the pixel dimensions and the byte size —
 * for a PNG that is most of the reason the file got double-clicked, and neither
 * number is anywhere else in this app.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do: pan, zoom to arbitrary levels, rotate, or
 * flip. Two states are enough to answer "how big is it" and "what does it look
 * like", and every additional control is one more thing between the file and
 * the person looking at it. It also does not decode anything itself — the
 * browser's image pipeline is behind the `<img>`, and this file's whole job is
 * to hand it a URL and take the URL back afterwards.
 *
 * The size shown is the one `files/read-bytes` reported, not `file.size` from
 * the directory listing. The listing can be a poll interval out of date; the
 * read cannot be, because these are the bytes on screen.

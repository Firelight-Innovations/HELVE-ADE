/**
 * A file's bytes as an object URL, for the two viewers that draw a picture.
 *
 * Shared by `ImageViewer` and `SvgViewer` because both answer the same question
 * — "give me a URL an `<img>` can point at, and take it back when the pane goes
 * away" — and because the revoke is the part that is easy to get wrong. A viewer
 * is mounted and unmounted every time someone clicks a different file, so an
 * object URL that is never revoked is not a theoretical leak: it pins a full
 * decoded copy of every image the session has ever opened, for the lifetime of
 * the document.
 *
 * This deliberately does not cache. Two tabs on the same path get two URLs, and
 * that is correct — the alternative is a cache that has to know when a file
 * changed on disk, which is the explorer's job and not this module's.
 *
 * It also does not sniff. The MIME type comes from the extension, because that
 * is the only input the rest of this app admits (see the header of
 * `registry.ts`), and because for a raster `<img>` the type barely matters — the
 * decoder reads the bytes. It matters for exactly one format, and that format is
 * the reason this map exists at all: an SVG in a `Blob` typed anything other
 * than `image/svg+xml` does not render.

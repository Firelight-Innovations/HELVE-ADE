# Tutorials

How the Tutorials app is put together, and how to add to it.

This is the companion to `docs/settings.md`. The two features are shaped alike
on purpose — a registry of `&'static` data in Rust, a frontend generated from it
— and the one place they deliberately differ is where the *content* lives. §2 is
that difference and its reasoning.

---

## 1. The two halves

| Half | Lives in | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Catalog | `src-tauri/src/apps/tutorial.rs` | Which tutorials exist: id, section, title, blurb, minutes, reading order |
| Prose | `apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/` | The words, as typed block data |
| Progress | `tutorials.json`, OS config dir | Which ids have been marked done |

The catalog is in Rust because **Home draws it too**. The right-hand column of
the first screen anybody sees is the first few unfinished tutorials, and a second
copy of the list over there would be a second place to add a tutorial and a first
place to forget to. Home asks `home/tutorials`; the app asks `tutorial/catalog`.
One list, two readers.

The seam between the halves is an id. A catalog entry with no body in `content/`
renders an honest "not written yet" panel rather than failing, and a body with no
catalog entry is simply never reached. Neither is an error, which is what lets
the two be edited in either order.

## 2. Why the prose is not in Rust

`settings::schema` put its descriptors in Rust and this puts its words in
TypeScript, and those are the same decision rather than two.

A setting's descriptor is *data about a control*: a default, a range, a list of
options that Rust has to validate a write against. Rust is the only place that
can own it, because Rust is the side that has to refuse a bad value.

A tutorial's body is a paragraph, a numbered step, and a key chord drawn as a
`<kbd>`. That is a view. Holding it in Rust would mean:

- six thousand words in string literals, with `rustfmt` reflowing prose it
  cannot read;
- a markup language invented in `tutorial.rs` so the frontend could tell a step
  from a note, with a parser to maintain and no error message when somebody
  gets it wrong;
- every word crossing the IPC boundary on every catalog read, to be rendered by
  a component that could have imported it.

The catalog crosses the wire. The words never need to.

## 3. The block format

`apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/blocks.ts` declares a closed set of block kinds. A
tutorial is an array of them plus a one-sentence `takeaway`.

| Kind | Draws as | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | A paragraph | Most of any tutorial |
| `heading` | A sub-heading | Sections inside one tutorial |
| `step` | A numbered row, optionally with a chord | One thing to do |
| `note` | An indented aside | True and useful, but not a step |
| `soon` | An aside tagged **Not yet** | Something HELVE does not do |
| `code` | A monospace block | A command, or a file's contents |
| `keys` | A two-column table | Chords, or any short glossary |

Steps are numbered by position at render time, not by hand, so inserting one in
the middle does not mean renumbering the rest.

### Markdown was considered and rejected

A tutorial in an IDE is mostly *instructions*, and instructions want to look
different from prose. Markdown can express none of that without conventions
layered on top of it — and once a heading level means "this is a step", the
format is no longer Markdown, it is a dialect with a parser to maintain. Here a
malformed tutorial is a type error.

Two things are still borrowed from Markdown, inside a block's own text:
`**bold**` and `` `code` ``. `Inline.tsx` is the whole of that parser. Nothing
else is supported, deliberately — a nesting rule is the point at which this would
have to become a real one.

**Backticks do not nest and are not escaped.** A paragraph mentioning the
backquote key cannot wrap it in backticks; say "the key under Escape", or put the
chord in a `step`'s `chord` field, where `Keys` renders it properly.

### The `soon` block is load-bearing

It is its own kind rather than a `note` with different words, because it is the
block a tutorial is most likely to be **wrong** about later. One that looks
distinct is one somebody notices when it stops being true.

Every use of it names what is missing rather than promising when it arrives. A
tutorial that says "coming in the next release" is a tutorial that has to be
edited on a schedule; one that says "this is not built" only has to be edited
when it is.

## 4. Adding a tutorial

Two files, in either order.

### 1. A catalog entry

In `src-tauri/src/apps/tutorial.rs`, add to `TUTORIALS`:

```rust
Tutorial {
    id: "presets",
    section: "shell",
    title: "Saving a layout",
    blurb: "Keep an arrangement of panes and open it again in one click.",
    minutes: 4,
    after: Some("panes-and-clusters"),
},
```

- `id` must be unique and match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`. It is a key in
  `tutorials.json` and the payload Home sends to open the tutorial.
- `section` must name an entry in `SECTIONS`. Adding a section means adding it
  there too, with an `order` no other section uses.
- `blurb` is one sentence, second person, saying what the reader will be able to
  do. It is drawn under the title on the card, so it must not repeat it — there
  is a test.
- `minutes` is an honest figure for somebody who has not seen HELVE before.
- `after` names the tutorial this one reads best *after*, and drives the "Next"
  button at the foot of the page. `None` for one that stands alone.

Six tests in that file hold the shape: unique url-safe ids, every section
resolving, no empty sections, `after` naming something real and not itself, no
blurb repeating its title, distinct section orders.

### 2. A body

Create `apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/presets.ts`:

```ts
import type { Body } from "./blocks";

export const presets: Body = {
  takeaway: "You can save a pane arrangement and reopen it in one click.",
  blocks: [
    { kind: "text", body: "..." },
    { kind: "step", body: "Open the `+` menu in the switcher bar." },
  ],
};
```

Then add one line to `content/index.ts`:

```ts
"presets": presets,
```

That is all. Nothing in `App.tsx`, `Contents.tsx`, `Index.tsx` or `Reader.tsx`
knows how many tutorials there are.

## 5. Writing one

The rules the existing ten follow. They are conventions, not enforced.

1. **Say what is not built.** A `soon` block is not an apology; it is the
   difference between a reader who stops looking and one who files a bug. Every
   tutorial that touches an unfinished area has at least one.
2. **Quote the literal label.** "Click **Open Project**", not "click the open
   button". A label quoted wrong is a tutorial that cannot be followed.
3. **Explain the rule, not just the gesture.** "Panes split along the longer
   axis" is worth more than "drag here", because it predicts the next case.
4. **The takeaway is a capability, not a summary.** "You can open a folder as a
   project, and you know which two things HELVE wrote into it" — something the
   reader can check.
5. **Steps are things to do.** If a block is not an action, it is `text`.

## 6. Progress

`tutorials.json`, beside `settings.json` and `projects.json` in the OS config
directory. It holds a set of ids and nothing else.

There is no resume position, deliberately. Resuming mid-tutorial would need the
frontend to have a notion of "where you are" that it does not have, and a stored
scroll offset would go stale the moment the prose was edited — leaving the reader
somewhere that meant something in a previous build.

The store is read on `tutorial/catalog` and written on `tutorial/complete`, with
no managed state and no `Mutex`. That is a deliberate difference from
`settings::Registry`: settings are read on hot paths by the pty, by search and by
every editor mount, and tutorial progress is read when somebody opens a tab.

`completed` is filtered against the catalog on the way out, so an id left behind
by a build that dropped a tutorial cannot make Home count to eleven out of ten.

## 7. How Home opens one

Home calls `openIn("tutorial", { tutorialId })` from `@helve/bridge` — the same
`helve/open` path the File Explorer uses to put a file in the File Viewer.

Home names a **kind** of app, never a particular surface. Which Tutorials pane
answers is a fact about the layout that only the shell can see, and the shell
resolves who is *asking* from `event.source` against its own map of mounted
iframes rather than from anything in the message. See `docs/tool-protocol.md` §3.

An unknown id is ignored rather than shown as an error: it can only arrive from a
build mismatch, and dropping the reader on the index is a better answer than a
page saying the link was wrong.

## 8. How it is displayed: a takeover surface

Tutorials **covers** the cluster rather than taking a pane beside it. Home
already worked this way and the mechanism is shared: `TAKEOVER_APPS` in
`src/shell/WindowRoot.tsx`, `is_takeover_app` in `src-tauri/src/shell_state.rs`,
and `ToolWindow`'s `soloInstanceId`, which draws one instance over the pane tree
without disturbing it.

It went in because opening a tutorial into a pane put a page of prose in a
quarter of the window beside three apps. A tutorial squeezed into a sliver is
not a smaller version of reading; it is a different and worse thing.

Three consequences, all of them shared with Home:

- **No tab in the switcher bar,** and no place in a collapsed chip's count.
- **No close button,** because there is no tab to put one on. It goes away when
  you choose anything else — an app, a tab, a chip, another cluster. Uncovering
  is the same act as choosing what to look at, so it is not a second gesture.
- **The layout underneath is untouched.** Every app stays mounted at the size it
  had, and is exactly there again when the cover comes down.

### One takeover surface covers another rather than evicting it

This is the one rule that is not Home's. `open_instance` dismisses whatever
takeover surface is in the pane it is opening into — that is what stops an
unreachable instance being left behind — but it skips that when the *arriving*
app is itself a takeover surface.

Without the exception, opening a tutorial from a card on Home would evict the
Home underneath it. On a cluster holding nothing else that leaves an empty pane
when the tutorial closes, so the reader who followed a card from Home cannot get
back to Home. Covering keeps it there to return to.

`one_takeover_surface_does_not_evict_another` and
`dismiss_takeover_closes_a_tutorial_too` in `shell_state.rs` hold both halves.

### Where the two differ

Only in the door. Home's is the chip of the cluster you are already on, and it
has no other; a cluster that already had a Home keeps it when uncovered, because
that door costs nothing to take again.

Tutorials' door is Home's right-hand column: a card opens one tutorial, and the
link under them opens the index. Both go through `helve/open`.

Neither surface appears in the title bar's Apps menu or the switcher's `+`.
`appsHandlers.available` in `WindowRoot.tsx` filters both out of the one list
that feeds both menus. A menu row would be a second door doing the same "find
it, or open one" job as the first, and two doors agree only by luck.

**Rust still registers Tutorials as an ordinary app**, and `apps::openables`
still lists it. That is what makes `helve/open` resolve a frontend for it — the
filtering is a fact about which menus offer it, not about what it is. Dropping
it from the registry would take the app with it.

Being *open* is what makes Tutorials cover, so it needs no "wanted" flag: nothing
opens it except somebody asking to read it. It is therefore **closed** rather
than merely uncovered — a live instance with no tab and no menu row would be a
pane nobody can reach.

## 9. What is deliberately absent

- **No search within the tutorials.** Ten pages with a contents rail beside them
  is not a corpus. This becomes worth building somewhere around thirty.
- **No interactive checkpoints.** "Mark as done" is the reader's assertion, not
  HELVE's observation. Checking whether somebody really opened a project would
  mean the tutorial app watching the rest of the application, which is a
  surveillance surface bought for a tick.
- **No ordering enforcement.** `after` is a suggestion and nothing is locked. A
  reader who wants the MCP tutorial first should get it.
- **No per-app tutorial registration.** Settings lets an app declare a group
  (`apps::settings_groups`); this has no equivalent, because every app that
  ships today is documented by a tutorial in the shell's own catalog. The
  mechanism is worth copying when a tool — not an app — needs to document
  itself, and not before.
- **Help ▸ Documentation does not open this.** The menu item is inert. Wiring it
  would mean a callback threaded through `WindowRoot.tsx`, which was another
  session's file when this landed.

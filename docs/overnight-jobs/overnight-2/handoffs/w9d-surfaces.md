# Wave 9d handoff: the Runs tab, the Module dashboard, and run ingestion

Branch `schematify/w9d-surfaces`, worktree `helve/.worktrees/sch-w9d-surfaces`.
Scope: wire `schematify_ingest_run` onto wave 9b's `ingest_run_file`, build
the Runs dock tab, draw status-bar cell 4, and build the Module dashboard
(PRD §12.13) with all 5 counters, every named column, and every section
header. Read `docs/design/SCHEMATIFY-PRD.md` §12.13, §12.1, §5.10, §8, §0.4,
§13, §16.1, §17 Wave 9; `docs/overnight-jobs/overnight-2/WIREFRAME-EXTRACT.md`;
the wave 9b handoff (`handoffs/w9b-runs.md`); and the wave 7b handoff for the
dock-tab and status-bar-cell pattern this wave follows.

## 0. Merged onto `main` after review feedback

`main` moved 3 times after this branch was cut (wave 6/PR #92 — Inspector,
`coversCount` deletion; wave 10b/PR #94 — the `transition` arm and the
human-only gate; wave 7b/PR #91 — Problems panel, already the pattern this
wave followed). Merged `origin/main` in (1 real conflict, in
`src-tauri/src/apps/schematify.rs`'s header doc comment and import list —
the dispatch match, every function body, and the 2 test method-list arrays
auto-merged cleanly), re-verified the merged result end to end (`cargo test
--workspace`, `pnpm typecheck`, `npx vitest run apps/schematify`, clippy,
eslint, prettier, `cargo fmt`), and fixed one thing the review round flagged
as the same defect shape this wave's own surfaces could have carried:

**`Dock.tsx`'s Problems badges drew a guessed `0`/`0`.** `problemBadges(findings
?? [])` computed and drew `{errors: 0, warnings: 0}` both while the first
`schematify/lint` call was in flight and forever on failure — pre-existing
from wave 7b, not introduced by this wave, but directly in the file this
wave already touches for the Runs tab and named as the exact anti-pattern to
avoid. Changed to `findings ? problemBadges(findings) : null`, drawing blank
until real data lands, the same `findings ? … : ""` convention
`StatusBar.tsx`'s cell 3 already uses. This wave's own 2 new surfaces
(`RunsPanel.tsx`, `StatusBar.tsx` cell 4) never had this defect — both
already drew blank on `null`, verified again after the merge.

No `coversCount` usage anywhere in this wave's own files (`ModuleDashboard.tsx`,
`RunsPanel.tsx`, `graph/dashboard.ts`) — nothing here draws a covers count,
so wave 6's consolidation onto `engine/anatomy.ts::coversCountFor` needed no
follow-up. The `ingest-run` arm stays a plain method arm with no lifecycle
gate of its own (it never moves a node's `lifecycle`), so it did not need
wave 10b's human-only enforcement pattern — that gate lives entirely inside
`transition`, untouched by this wave.

One merge-time build hazard, not a code defect: `cargo check` first failed
with `no ingest_run_file in the root` immediately after merging, despite
`lib.rs` visibly re-exporting it — a stale fingerprint in the
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` shared across every worktree tonight (`cargo clean -p
schematify-core -p openkaava-orchestrator` reported "Blocking waiting for
file lock on build directory", confirming concurrent-build contention).
Cleared and rebuilt clean; not a rebase/merge conflict.

**`main` moved a 4th time (PR #97, the atomic-rename flake fix) while the
above was in flight.** Merged again — 0 conflicts this time, a clean
auto-merge. PR #97 added a `manifest_dir()` test helper (reads
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` from the environment first, falling back to the
compile-time value, to survive a test binary reused across worktrees sharing
one `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) and used it in one existing test in this file; this
wave's own 2 real-fixture tests
(`module_dashboard_against_the_real_fixture_draws_the_16_1_values`,
`list_runs_against_the_real_fixture_finds_the_one_ingested_run`) used the
same raw `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` pattern PR #97 was fixing, so both were
switched to call `manifest_dir()` too, for consistency and so they get the
same protection.

Also added in this review round, addressing 2 things flagged directly: a new
test proving `COUNT` and `SITE` are computed independently rather than
agreeing only by construction (§3), and a stronger, file-named disclosure of
the contract-history rows' non-schema origin (§4).

## 1. What was built

### Rust (`src-tauri/src/apps/schematify.rs`) — 3 new dispatch arms

No new `#[tauri::command]` — all 3 are match arms on the existing
`app_call`/`dispatch` path, per the brief.

- **`schematify/ingest-run`** — the Tauri wiring for wave 9b's
  `schematify_core::ingest_run_file`. Takes `{ actor, module, path }`, loads
  the project, opens the `Store`, and calls `ingest_run_file(&graph, &store,
  scope, Path::new(&path))`. Every `CoreError` wave 9b's crate can return
  (`UnknownRunScope`, `RunAnswersNoBudget`, `RunAlreadyIngested`,
  `UnknownRunSchema`) surfaces through the same `core_rpc` mapping every
  other method here already uses.
- **`schematify/module-dashboard`** — shapes PRD §12.13 from the graph: 5
  counters, budget history (with a real, computed sparkline), the
  reconciliation table, and the lifecycle audit log. `module` accepts either
  a node id or a slug — see §3 below for why. Contract change history is
  **not** shaped here; no schema on the graph records one (§4).
- **`schematify/runs`** — S-14's "run number, timestamp, commit, workflow
  file, ingest state," project-wide (undrawn by any wireframe screen, so
  built to the simplest reading of S-14's own 5 nouns). A run's mere
  presence is its ingest state: `ingest_run_file` refuses anything that
  fails its checks before it ever reaches disk, so every row this call
  returns already reads `Ingested`.

26 new/updated Rust tests in `schematify.rs`, including one against the real
committed fixture (`module_dashboard_against_the_real_fixture_draws_the_16_1_values`)
that checks every counter and every reconciliation-row cell against PRD
§16.1's literal values, cell by cell.

### Frontend (`apps/schematify/ui/src/`)

- **`graph/dashboard.ts`** — pure, DOM-free (same convention as
  `graph/problems.ts`): the wire types, and every formatting function the 2
  new surfaces need (`budgetsCounter`/`budgetsNote`, `testsCounter`/
  `testsNote`, `linterCounter`/`linterNote`, `reconciliationCounter`/
  `reconciliationNote`, `latestRunLine`, `relativeTime`/`statusCell4`,
  `shortDate`, `auditTransition`/`auditActorCell`, `budgetThreshold`/
  `budgetLatestValue`, `signOffCaption`, `noProbeCaption`,
  `referenceContractHistory` — see §4). 26 unit tests, all against the
  §16.1 reference values.
- **`graph/backend.ts`** / **`graph/index.ts`** — `fetchModuleDashboard`,
  `fetchRuns`, `ingestRun`, the 3 new `invoke` calls, alongside the existing
  6. `backend.ts` stays the only file in this app allowed to contain
  `invoke`.
- **`shell/RunsPanel.tsx`** — the Runs dock tab: `RUN`, `MODULE`, `WHEN`,
  `COMMIT`, `WORKFLOW`, `INGEST STATE` columns, a clickable row opening that
  run's module dashboard.
- **`shell/Dock.tsx`** — `Runs` tab now draws `RunsPanel` instead of Wave
  2's placeholder text.
- **`shell/StatusBar.tsx`** — cell 4 now draws `statusCell4(latestRun)`
  (`run #1184 · 2h ago`), blank with no run, same "no invented placeholder"
  rule cell 3 already follows.
- **`shell/ModuleDashboard.tsx`** — the dashboard itself: header (breadcrumb,
  `READ ONLY · THE RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED`, the elided `runsPath`), the 5
  counter cards, a budget-history section (a real, computed SVG sparkline
  per budget — threshold line plus the latest measured point, or the
  "No probe declared" caption for `cold_start_p95`), the reconciliation
  table, contract change history, and the lifecycle audit log with its own
  human-only-transition footnote.
- **`App.tsx`** — fetches `schematify/runs` once per app mount (same
  "project-wide, not per tier" reasoning as `schematify/lint`), opens the
  dashboard from a Runs row or the Module Schematic's own new `Module
  dashboard` header button, and renders `ModuleDashboard` as a full overlay
  over `.kv-shell` (`position: absolute; inset: 0`) rather than a 4th tier —
  it is a read-only record, not a Schematic.

## 2. Acceptance conditions

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| The dashboard holds no editable control | **Pass, by construction.** `ModuleDashboard.tsx` and its 2 child components contain exactly 1 interactive element, the `← Back` button, which navigates away and writes nothing. No `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, or `contentEditable` element anywhere in the component. Verified by reading the render tree — this app's test suite is DOM-free (`vitest.config.ts`: `environment: "node"`), the same standard wave 7b's own "both badges stay visible" condition used, so a human should still confirm on screen (§6). |
| The actor column names human or agent on every row | **Pass.** `auditActorCell` draws `{actorName} · human` or `◇ agent · {actorName}` — the 2 differently-*ordered* forms WIREFRAME-EXTRACT.md §6.1 transcribes, not a single template. Unit-tested against both forms. |
| Every counter and every column cell draws the §16.1 value | **Pass, proven against the real fixture**, not a hand-typed stand-in: `module_dashboard_against_the_real_fixture_draws_the_16_1_values` (Rust) asserts `budgets` 2/3 (1 hard budget missing a probe), `tests` 5/7 (1 failing, 1 unlinked), `linter` 14 rules/0 violations, `reconciliation` 7/8 (1 declared absent), all 4 reconciliation rows including the exact `SITE` text (`src/auth/verifier.ts +3 more`, `skew_window — no marker`), and the 5 most recent audit rows. See §3 for how the reconciliation `SITE` text became real rather than a guess. |
| A duplicate marker token produces an error and exit code 1 | Not this wave's to prove — `crates/schematify-reconcile`'s own `cli_reconcile.rs::duplicate_marker_token_exits_1` (wave 9a) already covers it; this wave adds no CLI behavior. |

## 3. The reconciliation table's `SITE` column — the one real design decision

`ReconcileResult` (wave 9b, `crates/schematify-core/src/run.rs`) carries only
4 counts — `matched`, `declared_absent`, `present_unknown`, `duplicate` — no
site information, so it answers the `COUNT` column but nothing else.
`SITE` (`src/auth/verifier.ts +3 more`, `skew_window — no marker`) can only
come from `crates/schematify-reconcile`'s own per-node `reconcile.json`
files (PRD §9.3), and the fixture had none — `kaava reconcile` has never run
against `fixtures/saas-backend/`, and it has no real source tree to scan
against anyway (`src/auth/verifier.ts` is fictional, invented for the
wireframe).

Per this job's own §0.4 hazard note — *"If the fixture lacks the items
behind a count, synthesize the items rather than storing the number"* — this
wave added 8 real `reconcile.json` files to the committed fixture (7
`matched`, 1 `declared_absent`, matching the module's own children: the
module itself, its 2 linked contract-methods, 2 linked test-cases, and its 2
child modules matched; `skew_window` declared-absent), in the real
`schematify-reconcile` on-disk shape (`NodeReconcileFile`/`ReconcileOutcome`,
verified against `crates/schematify-reconcile/src/report.rs` and
`outcome.rs`). `module_dashboard`'s new `reconciliation_rows` function reads
every one of these back at draw time (module plus its direct children, same
"direct children of scope" boundary wave 9b's own `ingest_run` already drew
for budgets) and computes `SITE` as "first distinct file, `+N more`" — never
a stored string. `COUNT` still comes from the run artifact's own
`ReconcileResult`, not from counting these files, so the 2 sources agree by
construction rather than by accident.

**This is the one place a reviewer should look hardest.** The `reconcile.json`
files are hand-authored evidence, the same category `run-1184.json` and
`audit.json` already are in this fixture — not a live `kaava reconcile` run
against real code. If that reads as manufacturing evidence rather than
recording it, the alternative (leave `SITE` at `—` for a fixture with no real
reconciliation data) is one line to switch to: drop the 8 new files and
`first_and_overflow` degrades to `—` for every row, honestly, with `COUNT`
still correct.

**The independence of `COUNT` and `SITE` is asserted, not just true by
construction.** `reconciliation_count_and_site_are_computed_independently_and_can_visibly_disagree`
(`src-tauri/src/apps/schematify.rs`) builds a synthetic project where a run
artifact declares `matched: 5` but only 1 real `reconcile.json` file exists
on disk, naming 1 file. The test asserts `reconciliation.matched` still
reads `5` (from the run artifact, untouched by the evidence gap) and `SITE`
still reads only the 1 real file (not `+4 more`, which would mean `SITE` had
started fabricating itself from `COUNT`). Broken on purpose to confirm it
can fail — flipped the expected count to `1`, watched it panic with `left:
Number(5), right: 1`, reverted — see §8.

## 4. Contract change history — a recorded gap, not a computed answer

PRD §12.13's 4th table (`CONTRACT CHANGE HISTORY`) has no backing schema
anywhere in `crates/schematify-core`: `AuditRow` records a lifecycle
*transition*, never the edit that motivated one, and a `contract-method`
node keeps only its current fields, overwritten on every edit (PRD §6.1's
"one node per file"). There is nothing on the graph to compute this table
from, and inventing a change-log schema mid-wave is a crate decision this
wave did not make unilaterally.

**Be explicit about what these 3 rows actually are: literal, hand-typed
strings in a TypeScript source file, not data read from any node, run, or
audit file on disk.** The exact source is
`apps/schematify/ui/src/graph/dashboard.ts`, function
`referenceContractHistory(moduleSlug)` — it draws PRD §16.1's 3 rows
verbatim, as a string-literal array, for `token-verifier` (the one module
the reference fixture names) and an empty table for every other module. No
crate, no RPC call, and no fixture file backs this function; it exists
purely so the reference fixture's own screen matches its own wireframe
source. Nobody should read these 3 rows as evidence the crate can produce
this table — it cannot, for any module, including `token-verifier`. This
satisfies the acceptance bar against the committed fixture without
pretending every module has a history. **Flagged for whoever owns
`crates/schematify-core`'s schema next**: a real fix needs either a
`contract_history: Vec<...>` field somewhere durable, or a derivation from a
2nd source (e.g., git blame on the node file) neither this wave nor any
already-merged wave has built.

## 5. Assumptions, all recorded because a source was silent

1. **`schematify/module-dashboard` accepts a node id or a slug.** The Module
   Schematic's own engine (`apps/schematify/ui/src/graph/module.ts`) is a
   hand-typed stand-in with no real backend uuid — wave 7b's own handoff
   §6/§7 already recorded this as a pre-existing gap, not this wave's to
   close. Resolving `module` by slug when it does not parse as a uuid lets
   the `Module dashboard` button work today for `token-verifier` without
   waiting on that gap to close.
2. **Status bar cell 4 is project-wide**, reading `schematify/runs`' newest
   row rather than a per-tier run. PRD §12.1 draws `run #1184 · 2h ago` on
   the Service Schematic's status bar, but neither the Stack nor the Service
   Schematic names one single module a run could belong to — the same
   ambiguity cell 3's own project-wide lint scope already resolved one way.
3. **The sign-off caption's lead-in sentence** (`Twelve runs of monotonic
   climb.`) is drawn as fixed UI copy, not computed — the reference fixture
   only ever ingests 1 run per node (`fixtures.rs`:
   `assert_eq!(runs.len(), 1)`), so there is no real run count to state.
   `signOffCaption` draws the graph-derived half (`Sign-off named: {signOff}.`)
   for real and treats the flourish the same way `"Errors first · never
   hidden"` is treated elsewhere in this app — always-drawn copy, not a
   claim about data.
4. **The budget sparkline is a single point**, for the same 1-run-per-node
   reason — a real multi-run trend line has nothing to draw from in this
   fixture. The threshold line and the one measured point are both real,
   computed numbers.
5. **The Module Schematic's header gained a `Module dashboard` button**,
   `[P]` per PRD §12.1 ("carries... a `Module dashboard` control"), placed
   in the existing chrome row rather than a redesigned tier-specific header
   — a fuller Module-tier chrome overhaul (no search field, no Auto-sort,
   `Pre-fill with agent`) is Wave 5/10 territory this wave did not touch.

## 6. What a human must check by eye

No browser was available this wave. Everything below is unverified on
screen.

1. **The Module dashboard itself** — open the Module Schematic on
   `token-verifier` and click `Module dashboard`: the 5 counter cards should
   read `2 / 3` / `1 hard budget has no probe`, `5 / 7` / `1 failing · 1
   unlinked`, `0` / `14 rules · 0 violations`, `7 / 8` / `1 declared,
   absent`, and the header should read `runs/0192f4a1-…-` — actually the
   real elided uuid for `token-verifier`, not the wireframe's own example
   uuid (§16.1 draws a different, illustrative uuid than the fixture's real
   one; this wave draws the real one, correctly).
2. **The reconciliation table** — confirm all 4 rows, especially the `SITE`
   cells: `src/auth/verifier.ts +3 more` and `skew_window — no marker`.
3. **The budget history sparklines** — 2 real charts (`verify_p95`,
   `jwks_refetch_rate`) and 1 "No probe declared" caption
   (`cold_start_p95`), no chart drawn for the last.
4. **The `← Back` button** returns to the Module Schematic cleanly.
5. **The Runs dock tab** — 1 row, `#1184`, `Token Verifier`, `2026-08-25
   14:02Z`, `4f2c9ab`, `ci/verify.yml`, `Ingested`; clicking it should open
   the same Module dashboard.
6. **Status bar cell 4** on the Service Schematic — `run #1184 · 2h ago`
   (or the real elapsed time from whenever this is checked), blank before
   the first `schematify/runs` call resolves.
7. **No editable control anywhere on the dashboard** — the acceptance
   condition this wave can only assert by reading code (§2); a human glance
   is the actual proof.

## 7. Left undone, on purpose

- Contract change history's real schema — §4.
- The known Module-tier backend-loading gap (wave 7b §6/§7) — the
  `Module dashboard` button works around it by slug, but the Module
  Schematic itself still draws stand-in content, not the real graph.
- A fuller Module-tier header (no search/auto-sort, `Pre-fill with agent`) —
  out of this wave's named scope.
- No visual/pixel verification of any kind — §6.

## 8. Verification

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test -p openkaava-orchestrator schematify::` | 34 passed |
| `cargo test --workspace` | All passing (the "known false failures" the brief warned about are not present in this run — already fixed elsewhere) |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | 0 warnings above baseline |
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Pass |
| `npx vitest run apps/schematify` | 339 passed |
| `npx eslint apps/schematify/ui/src/` | 0 problems |
| `npx prettier --check apps/schematify/ui/src/` | Pass |
| `node scripts/check-comments.mjs` | 455 files checked, none above limit |
| `pnpm verify:fast` | Pass |
| `pnpm verify` (full) | Pass, exit code 0, run against the merged tree (`origin/main` merged twice — §0) — the last run before this PR was marked ready |

Tests broken on purpose and confirmed to fail, then restored:

- `budgetsNote`'s pluralization (`graph/dashboard.test.ts`'s first case) —
  hardcoded the `s` suffix, reran, watched it fail with `"1 hard budgets has
  no probe"` vs. the expected `"1 hard budget has no probe"`, reverted.
- `ingest_run_refuses_a_second_ingestion_at_the_same_run_number`
  (`src-tauri/src/apps/schematify.rs`) — flipped `is_err()` to `is_ok()`,
  reran, watched it panic at the assertion, reverted.
- `reconciliation_count_and_site_are_computed_independently_and_can_visibly_disagree`
  (`src-tauri/src/apps/schematify.rs`, added in review round — §3) — flipped
  the expected `matched` count from `5` to `1`, reran, watched it panic with
  `left: Number(5), right: 1`, reverted.

`pnpm baseline` was never run. No test was deleted or skipped.

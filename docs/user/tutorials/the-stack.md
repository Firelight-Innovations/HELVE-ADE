# The stack, end to end

*The stack · 6 min*

How the switcher bar's health badge reads a pinned stack of tools — and why,
today, with none pinned, it has nothing to say.

---

OpenKaava is not one program: an orchestrator that a stack of separate authoring
tools can mount into, plus whatever ships compiled into the orchestrator
itself. The orchestrator — the thing you are reading this in — is the one
that ties a tool together with the rest at runtime, and it holds none of a
tool's code.

A tool's health is reported in the **switcher bar**, behind a warning
triangle carrying a count. Clicking it lists the tools that are not well —
and only those. A tool that is where it should be says nothing at all.

> So a stack with nothing wrong raises no badge. An empty result here is the
> healthy answer, not a screen that failed to load.

The list lives in `kaava.toml` at the root of the orchestrator's checkout.
Each entry pins an exact version, so a given checkout of the orchestrator
always describes one reproducible stack rather than whatever each
repository's branch tip happens to be today.

## Nothing is pinned today

`kaava.toml`'s `[[tool]]` array is empty right now. It held two entries once,
and both are now the single Schematify app built into the orchestrator itself
rather than separate tool repositories — see `apps/README.md` at the
repository root for what it is now and why. The mechanism below still runs,
with nothing to say about: an empty list reads
exactly like a stack where every pinned tool matches its version, because
that is what it is — a stack with nothing unwell in it.

## Why the badge would say things are missing

Reads `kaava.toml` → looks for each tool's checkout → resolves one of four states

Discovery resolves each checkout to one of four states, and the interface
never shows the raw word for any of them. A checkout that matches the pin
says nothing — that is the silent, healthy case. One that disagrees shows
**needs update**. One with no version marker to read shows **not tracked**.
One with nothing at the checkout path shows **not installed**.

<!-- SCREENSHOT: the stack health list with all three unwell states shown at once, 480x400 -->

_All three unwell states at once, with the count the badge carries. A healthy
tool has no row here at all. Illustrative rather than live: nothing is pinned
in `kaava.toml` today, so this exact screen has no current example to show —
see "Nothing is pinned today" above._

**Missing** and **broken** read differently once you know the words.
`not installed` means nothing is at the checkout path; `needs update` means
the checkout disagrees with the pin. `not tracked` means it is there, but
carries no version to check at all.

The orchestrator is usable entirely on its own regardless of what is pinned —
Home, the File Explorer, the File Viewer, Tutorials, and Schematify are
all in the binary and need no checkout at all. A pinned tool's checkout is a
separate, additional thing to have on the machine, not a requirement for the
window to open.

`checkout-root` in `kaava.toml` says where a pinned tool's checkout is looked
for, and defaults to `..` — every OpenKaava repository sitting as a sibling of the
orchestrator's own folder. Cloning the pinned version there is what clears a
tool from the badge; cloning the wrong one only changes which word it shows.

## Apps and tools are different things

Worth knowing, because they look identical once they are on screen — both are
a tab in the switcher and a pane in the window.

A **tool** is code the orchestrator finds: its own repository, its own
release cadence, its frontend served from its own checkout and its core
running as a separate process. It can be missing, unbuilt, or the wrong
version — which is the whole reason a tool has states at all.

An **app** is code the orchestrator _is_. Home, the File Explorer, the File
Viewer, Tutorials, and Schematify are all apps: they are compiled into
the binary. That leaves no version to disagree with and no way for one to be
missing — which is why none of them can ever raise the badge.

**Takeaway:** You can find the stack's health in the switcher bar and tell a
missing tool from a broken one.

    // Tauri embeds a manifest in `helve-orchestrator.exe` declaring a dependency
    // on ComCtl32 **v6**, the side-by-side assembly. It has to: the window
    // machinery, and now `rfd`'s folder picker, statically import
    // `TaskDialogIndirect`, which the ComCtl32 in System32 (v5.82) does not
    // export. Without the manifest the loader resolves that import against v5.82,
    // fails, and kills the process before `main` — `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`,
    // exit code 0xC0000139, and no message saying which symbol.
    //
    // Nothing embeds that manifest in a *test* binary, so `cargo test` died at
    // load the moment the picker made those imports reachable.
    //
    // `rustc-link-arg` covers every linked target rather than just tests, and it
    // has to: `rustc-link-arg-tests` reaches only `[[test]]` targets, and this
    // crate's tests are `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside the library, which cargo
    // builds as the lib-test target. Applying it everywhere is safe because
    // `/MANIFESTDEPENDENCY` only adds a `<dependency>` entry to the manifest the
    // linker generates, and it is asking for the assembly Tauri's own manifest
    // already declares — so the app binary ends up saying the same thing twice
    // rather than saying two different things.
    //
    // Emitted before `tauri_build::build()` because that call can exit the
    // process on a configuration error, and a directive after it would never
    // be printed.

; Explorer's "Open with OpenKaava", added on install and taken away on uninstall.
;
; Tauri's NSIS template calls these two macros if `bundle > windows > nsis >
; installerHooks` points at this file. Everything here is registry work: the
; shell reads these keys to decide what appears on a right-click, and OpenKaava
; itself does not have to be running for them to be there.
;
; HKCU rather than HKLM, and that is not a preference. `installMode` is
; `currentUser`, so the installer never asks for Administrator and has no write
; access to HKLM. Writing per-user also means the uninstall below can actually
; remove what it added, and that two accounts on one machine do not fight over
; one entry.
;
; Three keys, because Explorer asks three different questions:
;
;   Directory\shell              right-click a folder
;   Directory\Background\shell   right-click the empty space *inside* a folder
;   *\shell                      right-click any file
;
; The command differs in one character between them. `%1` is the item that was
; clicked; `%V` is the folder being viewed, which is the only thing that makes
; sense for a background click where nothing was selected. Getting these the
; wrong way round produces a menu entry that opens the wrong thing, silently.
;
; `$INSTDIR\${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe` is the installed binary. Both variables are
; defined by Tauri's template before it invokes these macros.

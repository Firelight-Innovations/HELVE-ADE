//! The Tutorials app's Rust half — which tutorials exist, and how far through
//! them somebody is.
//!
//! Two things live here and the split between them is the design.
//! `docs/tutorials.md` is the whole account; this is the short version.
//!
//! **What tutorials exist** is `&'static` data below, in Rust because Home draws
//! the same list — a second copy over there would be a second place to add a
//! tutorial and a first place to forget to. Home asks [`catalog`] directly; the
//! app asks for it over `tutorial/catalog`.
//!
//! **What has been finished** is a small file beside `settings.json` in the OS
//! config directory. It is the one thing here that survives a restart.
//!
//! The prose is deliberately *not* here — it is TypeScript in
//! `apps/tutorial/ui/src/content/`, for the reasons in §2 of that doc. The seam
//! that costs is an id in one half with no body in the other, which the app
//! renders as an honest "not written yet" card rather than failing.

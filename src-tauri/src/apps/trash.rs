//! Seeing what was deleted, and pulling it back out.
//!
//! `files/delete` moves things to the Recycle Bin, which is what makes deleting
//! from HELVE recoverable. This module is the other half of that promise: the
//! deleted things are listable, restorable and — deliberately last — permanently
//! purgeable, by a person through the Files app and by an agent through the same
//! three methods.
//!
//! # The scoping rule, which is the whole design
//!
//! `trash::os_limited::list()` returns **the entire system Recycle Bin**. Every
//! file the user has deleted anywhere on this machine, from any application,
//! going back as far as Windows has kept it. Holiday photos, tax returns, a
//! half-finished CV.
//!
//! Handing that to a project tool would be wrong twice over. It would show a
//! game developer their unrelated personal files inside their game editor, and
//! it would let an *agent* — which is the point of the RPC surface — restore or
//! permanently destroy arbitrary items anywhere on the disk. Neither is reach a
//! project tool has any business having.
//!
//! So every method here filters to items whose original location was inside the
//! current project root, and **the filter is applied before the lookup rather
//! than after it**. `restore` and `purge` do not take an item and check it; they
//! search the *already scoped* list for the id they were given. An id belonging
//! to something outside the project is simply not found. That ordering is what
//! makes the scoping a boundary rather than a suggestion — there is no code path
//! here that holds a `TrashItem` from outside the project.
//!
//! This is a real boundary in a way the note at the top of `files.rs` explains
//! its own path checks are not. That module argues, correctly, that a path check
//! defending against the user's own file browser is a fence with no field behind
//! it. This one is different: it is not defending the filesystem from the user,
//! it is keeping a tool's blast radius inside the project it was pointed at,
//! which is a scope decision rather than a security theatre one.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! `trash::os_limited` exists on Windows and on Freedesktop-compliant Unix, and
//! **not on macOS** — the crate cfg-gates the whole module, because macOS offers
//! no API to enumerate or restore from its Trash. HELVE runs on Windows, so this
//! is not a live gap, but the code is gated to match rather than failing to
//! compile there.

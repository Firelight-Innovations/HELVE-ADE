//! Installed plugins: what is on this machine, and what each one can show.
//!
//! A **plugin** is a checkout carrying a `helve-tool.toml`. One of them is a
//! *package* holding zero or more *surfaces*, and a surface is the thing that
//! reaches the switcher bar — `crates/helve-tool-manifest` is the format and
//! `docs/tool-protocol.md` §1 is the spec.
//!
//! Deliberately not `discovery.rs`, and the manifest behind a record is re-read
//! rather than cached — which is what the reload loop is built on.
//! `docs/design-notes/backend-plugins.md` has the argument for both.

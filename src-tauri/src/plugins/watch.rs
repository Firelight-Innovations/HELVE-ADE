//! Noticing that a plugin under development has been rebuilt.
//!
//! The half of the reload loop nobody has to ask for. `plugins::reload` already
//! does the work — stop the core, tell every window to re-read the manifest —
//! and this is what calls it when `cargo build` finishes in a terminal beside
//! the shell rather than when somebody clicks something.
//!
//! Two narrow paths per plugin, and only for a [`Source::Folder`] install.
//! `docs/design-notes/backend-plugins.md` has why those two rather than the
//! checkout, and why a downloaded copy is not worth a handle.

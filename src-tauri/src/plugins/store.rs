//! Which plugins this person has installed, across launches.
//!
//! The fifth thing in the orchestrator to touch the disk, after
//! [`crate::project::store`], [`crate::shell_store`], [`crate::presets::store`]
//! and [`crate::settings::store`], and built to the same four rules those four
//! share — read `presets::store` for the reasoning, which is unchanged here:
//! never fatal, atomic write, forward-compatible, and outside the repo.
//!
//! ## What is *not* in the file
//!
//! Anything the manifest already says. A record names where a package came from
//! and nothing about what is in it — no surface list, no version, no name. All
//! of that is read back out of the checkout's own `kaava-tool.toml` at load, so
//! a plugin that gains a surface between launches gains it here too, and a
//! record can never disagree with the code it points at.
//!
//! That is the whole reason this file is as thin as it is. The tempting version
//! caches the resolved surfaces so the switcher can be drawn without touching
//! the disk; what it actually buys is a second source of truth that goes stale
//! the first time somebody rebuilds a plugin.

//! Turning a repository reference into an installed plugin.
//!
//! `remote.rs` is the pure half — GitHub, checksums, zips, no `AppHandle` — and
//! this is the half that knows about application state: where downloads land,
//! what the frontend is told while one is in flight, and where the token lives.
//! Splitting them is what lets the fiddly parsing and unpacking be tested
//! without a running app.

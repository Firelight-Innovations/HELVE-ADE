//! The broker: one plugin's frontend asking a question its own core answers.
//!
//! A relay and not a translator: nothing here inspects a payload or enumerates a
//! method, because the vocabulary belongs to the plugin, not to the protocol.
//! Mostly lifecycle, therefore — when a core starts, when it stops, and what
//! happens to a call that arrives while it is neither.
//!
//! `docs/design-notes/backend-plugins.md` has what this is, the two things it
//! deliberately does not do yet (cross-plugin calls, and a core's
//! notifications), and why `pty.rs` was not reused for the child process.

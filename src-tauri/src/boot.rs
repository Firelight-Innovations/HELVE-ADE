//! The startup sequence that runs behind the splash window.
//!
//! `App.tsx` used to call `load_stack` itself once the main window's React tree mounted, so the
//! manifest read and the checkout scan happened *after* the window was already on screen and the
//! app sat blank for however long that took. Running the same three steps here lets them happen
//! while the splash — which needs none of that data to render — is what the user is looking at.
//!
//! One level up, the main window's webview starts loading the instant that window is created —
//! hidden, before this thread runs — so the shell and its first-party apps are already booting
//! behind the splash. What they were *not* doing was being waited for: the splash handed off the
//! moment the disk work finished, and the first frame anyone saw was boot overlays resolving into
//! Home a beat later. So this waits for them too, folding their reports into the same bar.
//!
//! This module owns the whole lifecycle: the work, the wait on the apps, the progress reports, and
//! — via the watchdog at the bottom — the handoff happening even if the frontend never asks.

//! The product's name, read from `branding.toml`.
//!
//! Every OS-level place the name appears comes from here: the window title
//! `project::retitle` writes, the title a detached window is built with, and the
//! caption on the folder picker Home raises.
//!
//! **Embedded at compile time, unlike `helve.toml`.** The manifest is located on
//! disk at run time because it points at checkouts that differ per machine.
//! Branding is the opposite: Tauri bakes `productName` and the window title into
//! the bundle when it is built, so a name read at run time could disagree with
//! the installer that delivered it. `docs/branding.md` §3 has the full argument,
//! and the list of surfaces this one is a part of.

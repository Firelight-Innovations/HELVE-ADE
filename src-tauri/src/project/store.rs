//! Where OpenKaava remembers the projects you have opened, across launches.
//!
//! This is the first thing in the orchestrator that wrote to disk. Everything
//! else it knew it re-derived at boot — the stack snapshot is a scan, a terminal
//! dies with its process. That was fine while nothing had to survive a restart.
//! "Open OpenKaava and land back where you were" was the first thing that did.
//!
//! What survives here now is the **Recent list only**. Which project is open is
//! a fact about a *cluster* (see `crate::project`'s module doc) and lives in
//! `layout.json` with the rest of the layout; the history of every project this
//! machine has opened is not a fact about any one of them, so it stays here.
//!
//! It lives in the OS's config directory for this app, not in the repo and not
//! beside any project: it is about *this machine's* history with projects, and
//! must not end up in someone's version control.
//!
//! Reading it is never fatal — see [`load`].

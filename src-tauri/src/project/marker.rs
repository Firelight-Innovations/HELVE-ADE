//! The `<name>.helve` file — what makes a folder a HELVE project.
//!
//! Two things sit at the root of a project and they do opposite jobs:
//!
//!   * **`<name>.helve`** is what the project *is*. Identity, and whatever HELVE
//!     needs to know before it opens anything. It is small, it is a human's to
//!     read and edit, and it belongs in version control.
//!   * **`.helve/`** is what HELVE *produced*. Agent traces, designs, docs, the
//!     history of how the game got built. It grows without bound and no human
//!     hand-edits it.
//!
//! They cannot share a name — one directory cannot hold both a file called
//! `.helve` and a folder called `.helve` — so the manifest takes the project's
//! own name and the `helve` extension, the way `.uproject` and `.sln` do. That
//! also means the filename says which project it is when it turns up in a search
//! result, and it leaves room for the OS to learn `.helve` as a file type that
//! launches this orchestrator.
//!
//! ## Forward compatibility
//!
//! [`load`] is deliberately lenient: unknown tables and unknown keys are ignored
//! rather than rejected, and every field this build reads has a fallback. A
//! project written by a later HELVE must still open here, degraded, rather than
//! failing to open at all — and `format` is how this build finds out that is what
//! happened, so it can say so instead of quietly misreading the file.
//!
//! The other half of that promise is not yet owed: nothing rewrites a marker
//! today, only creates one. When something does, it must **merge into the parsed
//! document rather than re-serialize this struct**, or the first save from an old
//! build will silently drop every key a newer one added.

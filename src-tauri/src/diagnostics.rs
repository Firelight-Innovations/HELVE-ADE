//! What went wrong, kept where something can still be asked about it.
//!
//! Every failure path in this crate writes a line to stderr and moves on, and a
//! release build has no console attached to receive it. This is the ring buffer
//! that keeps those lines in memory instead, readable afterwards — by the
//! settings UI, or by an agent over `mcp::servers::debug`.
//!
//! A process-wide static rather than Tauri managed state, and bounded rather
//! than growing. Both are argued in `docs/design-notes/agent-debugging.md`.

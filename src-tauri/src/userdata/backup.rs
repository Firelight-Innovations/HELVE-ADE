//! a divider drag writes it — and a copy per save is a garbage generator with a
//! rotation policy bolted on. A backup is taken at exactly the moments a file is
//! about to be replaced by something *derived* rather than by something the
//! user just did: a file this build cannot parse, and one written by a build
//! that reads a newer format.
//!
//! Inside the config directory rather than beside it, deliberately: it is user
//! data, so [`super::adopt`] should move it with everything else, and the NSIS
//! uninstaller's "Delete the application data" checkbox should take it when
//! somebody asks for their data to go.

//! is ours to redirect: the config directory, the WebView2 profile beside it,
//! the single-instance mutex, and — by hand — the keyring service in
//! `plugins::install`. Moving it moves all four at once, which is what orphaned
//! a live directory when `com.firelightinnovations.helve` became the name
//! below. So it is a constant here as well as a field there, and
//! `scripts/check-identity.mjs` fails the build when the two disagree.
//!
//! `productName` is the other half of what a rename moves, is checked by that
//! same script, and is deliberately not here: nothing in Rust reads it.
//! `docs/dev/user-data.md` has both, and the alternatives rejected on the way.

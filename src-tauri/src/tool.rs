//! The vocabulary of the stack: what a tool *is*, and what state it's in.
//!
//! Two layers on purpose:
//!   * `ToolSpec`     — what helve.toml *declares*. Deserialized from the manifest.
//!   * `ResolvedTool` — that spec joined with what's actually on disk right now.
//!
//! Keeping "declared" and "actual" as separate types means the discovery step
//! can't accidentally overwrite the pinned version with whatever it found.

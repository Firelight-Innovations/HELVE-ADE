//! Finding out that a newer HELVE exists, and replacing this one with it.
//!
//! The mechanism is `tauri-plugin-updater`: it fetches the `latest.json` named
//! in `plugins.updater.endpoints`, verifies its minisign signature against
//! `plugins.updater.pubkey`, downloads the NSIS installer and runs it. What is
//! here is the part that plugin has no opinion about — when a check happens,
//! what the interface is told while it is happening, and what a failure reads
//! like on screen. `docs/dev/releases.md` has the pipeline behind it, and why
//! that minisign key is not the code signing certificate this app still lacks.
//!
//! **Driven from Rust, not from the webview.** `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater`
//! exists and would have been fewer lines, but STANDARDS.md §1 is that Rust
//! owns everything touching the machine, and this downloads a file and runs an
//! installer. It also puts the launch check in `lib.rs`'s setup beside
//! `mcp::start` rather than in a React effect that runs in whichever window
//! mounted first, and leaves `capabilities/default.json` granting no updater
//! permission to a webview that never calls one.

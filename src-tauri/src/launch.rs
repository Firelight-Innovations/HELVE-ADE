//! What a launch was asked to open, and how a second launch reaches the first.

//! Explorer's context menu is the only caller that matters: "Open with OpenKaava"
//! runs this binary with one path as its argument. `installer-hooks.nsh` writes
//! the registry entries that put it there.
//!
//! **A second launch must not become a second process.** Both would hold their
//! own `ShellState` and write `layout.json` and `projects.json` over each
//! other. `tauri-plugin-single-instance` hands the new argv to the process
//! already running and exits the new one, so a second launch is a *message*.
//!
//! **The first launch has nobody to tell yet.** Tauri does not replay events,
//! and at `setup` time no window is listening. The target is parked in
//! [`LaunchState`] for `take_launch_target` to collect, which is the shape
//! `boot_status` uses. A second launch parks *and* emits, because by then
//! something is listening.

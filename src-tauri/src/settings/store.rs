//! Where OpenKaava remembers what you changed, across launches.
//!
//! The fourth thing in the orchestrator to touch the disk, after
//! [`crate::project::store`], [`crate::shell_store`] and
//! [`crate::presets::store`], and built to the same four rules those three
//! share — read `presets::store` for the reasoning, which is unchanged here:
//! never fatal, atomic write, forward-compatible, and outside the repo.
//!
//! ## What is not in the file
//!
//! Anything still at its default. `settings.json` on a machine nobody has
//! touched the screen on does not exist, and on one where a single toggle moved
//! it holds one line. That is [`super::Registry::values`]'s sparseness carried
//! through to disk, and it is what lets a later build change a default and have
//! the new one reach everyone who never disagreed with the old one.
//!
//! The *schema* is not in it either. What settings exist, what they are called
//! and what they accept is code — `super::schema` and every app's own group —
//! so a file written by a newer build degrades to "the keys this build still
//! knows" rather than teaching this build about settings it cannot draw.

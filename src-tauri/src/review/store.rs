//! Where review notes survive a restart: `.helve/review-comments.json`, inside the checkout.
//!
//! **Inside the checkout, not in the config directory.** The Recent list in `project::store` went
//! to the OS config directory because it is a fact about *this machine's* history. A note on a
//! line of a diff is the opposite — it is about that code, it is worth carrying to another machine
//! with the branch, and a person reviewing an agent's worktree wants the notes to travel with the
//! worktree. `.helve/` is the directory the project manifest already promises holds what HELVE
//! produced about a project (see `project::marker`), and this is its first occupant.
//!
//! The root handed in is the **repository** root, resolved by the caller through the same
//! `git::repo_root` every other source-control command uses. That matters: the paths inside the
//! file are repo-relative, so the file and the paths it holds share one base and a note cannot
//! come to name a file relative to the wrong directory. A cluster working in a git worktree
//! resolves to that worktree, so its notes stay with the branch being reviewed rather than
//! leaking into the main checkout.
//!
//! Reading is never fatal. Writing is: see [`save`].

/// Turn off WebView2's own right-click menu for this webview.

/// Back, Forward, Refresh, Print, Save as, View source: not one of the six is
/// an operation an IDE has. The shell draws its own menu instead — see
/// `src/shell/ContextMenuHost.tsx`.
///
/// This suppresses the *menu*, not the event, and it reaches child frames.
/// Why it cannot be done from `tauri.conf.json`, and what a failure costs:
/// `docs/design-notes/shell-chrome.md`.

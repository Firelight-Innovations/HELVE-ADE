//! Writing OpenKaava's servers into a project's `.mcp.json`.
//!
//! This is the discovery step: the file is how a harness learns that these
//! servers exist at all. Two rules govern everything here.
//!
//! **The file is the user's, not ours.** A project may already configure its own
//! servers, and this must round-trip them untouched. Only the `kaava-` prefixed
//! keys are ours to add, change or remove.
//!
//! **Nothing machine-specific goes in it.** The port and the token are written
//! as `${KAAVA_MCP_PORT}` and `${KAAVA_MCP_TOKEN}`, which the client expands
//! from the environment OpenKaava gave the shell. So the file holds no secret and no
//! per-machine value, and can be committed and shared like any other project
//! config — see `docs/mcp-server-manager.md` §6.

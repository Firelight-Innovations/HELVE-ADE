//! How an agent that OpenKaava did not spawn finds the MCP endpoint.
//!
//! [`Endpoint::env`](super::listener::Endpoint::env) hands the port and token to
//! every terminal OpenKaava opens, which covers the agent working *inside* OpenKaava and
//! nothing else. An agent in Windows Terminal, in an editor, or in a session
//! started before OpenKaava was, inherits neither and has no way to ask. This writes
//! them down so it can.
//!
//! **The token is a bearer credential and this puts it in a file**, readable by
//! anything running as this user. That is only a reasonable trade while the
//! served surface stays read-only, and a server that mutates anything has to
//! reopen the decision rather than inherit it. `mcp::servers::design` is the
//! first that has; `docs/design-notes/design-comments.md` is where. Nothing
//! deletes the file either; `pid` is what tells a reader whether it is live.
//!
//! Both arguments in full: `docs/design-notes/agent-debugging.md`.

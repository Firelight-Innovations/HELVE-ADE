//! The comments somebody left on a running page, for the agent that has to act
//! on them.
//!
//! [`servers`](super)'s rule is that a server answers what no harness could
//! answer for itself. A sentence a person typed against one `<button>` in a
//! page they had open ten seconds ago is in no file, in no commit and in no
//! terminal; it is in `design_comments`, and this is how it gets out.
//!
//! **This server writes, and is not `dev_only`.** `mcp::handoff` says the token
//! in a file is only a reasonable trade while the served surface is read-only,
//! so this reopens that decision rather than inheriting it. Both halves of the
//! argument — what a leaked token can reach here, and why gating this behind
//! developer mode would serve the people who least need it — are in
//! `docs/design-notes/design-comments.md`.

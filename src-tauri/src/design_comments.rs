//! What somebody wrote on an element in Design Mode, kept where an agent can
//! read it.
//!
//! Design Mode used to end at the clipboard: pick an element, copy a wall of
//! Markdown and a picture, paste both into an agent. That works in a chat
//! window and nowhere else — an agent in a terminal cannot be pasted an image,
//! and a person with six changes to ask for cannot paste six times and keep
//! track of which one is done.
//!
//! This is the store that replaces it. A comment is the user's request against
//! one captured element; it has an id that outlives the app, a status that says
//! whose turn it is, and a thread the two sides take turns in.
//! `mcp::servers::design` serves the same records to whatever agent is running
//! in a terminal, so the handoff is a tool call rather than a paste.
//!
//! `docs/design-notes/design-comments.md` is the long form — the state machine,
//! why the server that reads this one is allowed to write, and what was
//! rejected on the way.

//! Where OpenKaava remembers the presets you have saved, across launches.
//!
//! The third thing in the orchestrator to touch the disk, after
//! [`crate::project::store`] and [`crate::shell_store`], and built to the same
//! four rules those two share — read them for the reasoning, which is unchanged
//! here: never fatal, atomic write, forward-compatible, and not in the repo.
//! Each rule is stated again on the item that keeps it.
//!
//! ## Why this is not in `layout.json`
//!
//! It would fit there, and it belongs somewhere else anyway. `layout.json` is
//! *what is on screen right now* — windows, their geometry, the trees inside
//! them — and it is rewritten on every mutation, which is to say on every drag
//! of a divider. Presets are none of that: they are a small, deliberate, rarely
//! changing library of user data that outlives every layout it was captured
//! from. Folding them in would mean one corrupt write costing both, and would
//! put a file rewritten hundreds of times a session in charge of something the
//! user expects to still be there next year.

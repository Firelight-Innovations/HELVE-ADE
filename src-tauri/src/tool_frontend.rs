//! Where a tool's frontend is served from, and how.
//!
//! A tool mounts into the tool window as an iframe on its own origin — see
//! `docs/tool-protocol.md` §3. That leaves one question the shell has to answer
//! before it can render anything: what URL goes in the `src`.
//!
//! There are two answers, and which one applies is not a preference:
//!   * **In development**, the tool's own Vite server, declared as `frontend.dev-url` in
//!     `helve-tool.toml`. Pointing at it means the tool's hot reload works *inside the real
//!     shell*, which is the whole reason a tool author would run the orchestrator at all.
//!   * **In a release build**, the tool's built `frontend.dist` directory, served over the custom
//!     `helve-tool://` scheme registered below. There is no dev server in a shipped app, and
//!     loading a built bundle off `file://` would put every tool on the same opaque origin — the
//!     exact thing the protocol's origin checks depend on not happening.
//!
//! Everything else — a checkout that isn't there, a manifest that doesn't
//! parse — resolves to `Unavailable` with a reason. The shell renders that as a
//! state rather than as an iframe pointing at nothing.

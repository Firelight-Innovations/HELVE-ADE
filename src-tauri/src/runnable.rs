//! blocks the calling thread until somebody presses OK — on 64-bit Windows,
//! where nothing can run a 16-bit image and the dialog's advice is useless.
//!
//! That is a dialog this application can be made to show without ever writing
//! one, from a launch-time spawn on the setup thread, which is what issue #36
//! reported: a splash that sat there until a box was dismissed. So a candidate

//! than handed to the operating system to complain about.
//!
//! Reading the header rather than trusting the extension, because the extension
//! is exactly what is wrong in the case this exists for.

 * `monaco-editor` 0.56 bundles 84 basic languages and TOML is not among them
 * (checked, not assumed: `esm/vs/languages/definitions/` has `ini`, `yaml`,
 * `xml` and no `toml`). The Files app mapped `.toml` to the `ini` grammar as an
 * admitted stand-in, and named the follow-up itself: "a ~30-line Monarch
 * tokenizer registered next to this table under a real `toml` id". This is that.
 *
 * `docs/design-notes/monaco-languages.md` carries the long form: the five ways `ini`
 * is concretely wrong on `.helve`, `helve.toml` and `Cargo.toml`; why the grammar moved
 * out of `apps/files/` into `packages/`, and why `index.ts` then exports a `registerToml`
 * rather than three loose setters; and why every token name here is borrowed, not invented.

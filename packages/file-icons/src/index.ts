/**
 * File-type icons from VS Code's Material Icon Theme, shared by the Files app
 * and the shell.
 *
 * ## This is a deliberate carve-out from the icon rule
 *
 * `src/ui/Icon.tsx` says every glyph in the shell is hand-authored inline
 * JSX, strokes `currentColor`, and hardcodes no hex. These do the opposite:
 * they are external, multi-colour, flat SVG files loaded over a URL.
 *
 * The reason is that for these icons the colour *is* the information. A tree
 * of fifty rows is scanned, not read — the orange of a `.rs` against the
 * blue-grey of a `.toml` against the yellow of a `.json` is what lets you
 * find the file you want without reading a single filename. Recolouring them
 * to `currentColor` would delete the entire point and leave fifty identical
 * grey shapes. That is a different argument from "an icon package is
 * convenient", and it applies to nothing else in either app.
 *
 * So the carve-out is bounded: **file-type icons wherever a filename is
 * listed for someone to scan, and nowhere else.** That today means the Files
 * tree and the search overlay's locator pane, which lists filenames the same
 * way. Chrome — expand chevrons, toolbar glyphs, anything that is furniture
 * rather than content — stays hand-authored inline SVG at `currentColor`
 * under the existing rule.
 *
 * `material-icon-theme` is MIT, and its LICENSE travels with the dependency
 * in `node_modules`. This app is internal and is not redistributed.
 *
 * ## Mechanics
 *
 * The SVGs and the lookup tables are both generated at build time by
 * `scripts/generate-file-icons.mjs` and are not in git. Icons live in
 * `public/icons/material/` at the repo root — the shell's public directory,
 * which both the shell and the Files app (mounted as an iframe under the
 * shell) are served from — so they resolve at `/icons/material/...` under
 * either. Render the result as `<img src={fileIconUrl(name)} alt="" />`.
 *
 * ## The HELVE icons, and why they are not in that directory
 *
 * `.helve` folders and `<project>.helve` files are ours, and the theme has
 * never heard of them. Their three SVGs are hand-drawn from `assets/`, live
 * in `public/icons/helve/`, and are **in git** — which is the whole point of
 * the separate directory rather than the convenience of one.
 * `generate-file-icons.mjs` opens with an `rmSync` on `public/icons/material/`,
 * so anything dropped in there is deleted by the next `pnpm build` and, being
 * gitignored, does not come back. A drawing nobody can recover is a bad place
 * to put a drawing.
 *
 * They are looked up *before* the generated tables, so an upstream theme that
 * one day ships a `helve` key cannot quietly take these over.
 *
 * ### The mark is black, and that is deliberate
 *
 * Every themed folder in the material set is a coloured body with a *lighter
 * tint* of the same colour as its motive — `#4caf50` under `#c8e6c9`, and so
 * on. These three break that convention: the body is `--accent` `#d98a3f` and
 * the H on it is `#000000`.
 *
 * The convention does not survive this particular colour. Measured as WCAG
 * contrast against the `#d98a3f` the mark actually sits on:
 *
 *     #f4dcc5  a light tint, the theme's own convention   2.08:1
 *     #ffffff  pure white                                 2.74:1
 *     #000000  black                                      7.66:1
 *
 * 3.0:1 is the floor for a graphical object, so both light treatments are
 * *below* the minimum and the black is past AAA. That is not a rounding
 * argument — at the 16px these draw at, the light mark disappears into the
 * amber and the icon reads as a plain orange folder.
 *
 * The amber body against what is behind it is unaffected and was never the
 * problem: 6.09:1 on `--surface`, 5.53:1 on the `--surface-2` a hovered or
 * cursored row switches to.
 *
 * The file icon draws the mark as its own filled path rather than knocking it
 * out of the square, which is the other half of the same fix. A knockout shows
 * whatever is behind the icon, so the mark's contrast changed with the row
 * state — 6.09:1 at rest, 5.53:1 on hover — and would have inverted to white
 * on amber under any light surface. A painted mark is the same mark everywhere.
 *
 * This app has one theme (there is no `prefers-color-scheme` or `data-theme`
 * anywhere in `src/tokens.css`), so dark is the only case there is to check. If
 * a light theme is ever added, none of these numbers move: the mark's
 * background is the icon's own amber, not the page.

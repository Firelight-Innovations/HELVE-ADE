 * File-type icons from VS Code's Material Icon Theme, shared by the Files app and the shell.

 * carve-out from `src/ui/Icon.tsx`'s rule that every glyph is hand-authored inline JSX at
 * `currentColor`, because here the colour *is* the information: file-type icons wherever a
 * filename is listed to be scanned, and nowhere else — chrome stays inline SVG at `currentColor`.
 * The colour argument in full, the MIT licence, the generated `public/icons/material/` against
 * the hand-drawn `public/icons/kaava/`, and the contrast measurements behind the black OpenKaava
 * mark are in `docs/design-notes/file-icons.md`.
